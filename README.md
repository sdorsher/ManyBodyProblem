This is a many body problem simulation using Newtonian
Mechanics. Steven Brandt suggested the idea to me in January 2019
after I'd been unemployed a long time after recieving my terminal
masters from Louisiana State University. He was on my masters
committee (Dec 2017) and is a good friend. I am extremely grateful for his
continued help.
